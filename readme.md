## Technical Notes

### CI/CD Setup with GitHub Actions

1. **Create a `.github/workflows` directory**:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p .github/workflows
        ```

2. **Add a workflow file**:
        ```yaml
        name: CI/CD Pipeline

        on: [push, pull_request]

        jobs:
            build:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest

                steps:
                - name: Checkout code
                    uses: actions/checkout@v2

                - name: Set up Node.js
                    uses: actions/setup-node@v2
                    with:
                        node-version: '14'

                - name: Install dependencies
                    run: npm install

                - name: Run tests
                    run: npm test
        ```

### Dev Containers

1. **Create a `.devcontainer` directory**:
        ```bash
        mkdir .devcontainer
        ```

2. **Add a `devcontainer.json` file**:
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Node.js & TypeScript",
            "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/typescript-node:0-14",
            "settings": {
                "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
            },
            "extensions": [
                "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
                "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
            ],
            "postCreateCommand": "npm install"
        }
        ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**:
        ```dockerfile
        FROM node:14

        WORKDIR /app

        COPY package*.json ./

        RUN npm install

        COPY . .

        EXPOSE 3000

        CMD ["npm", "start"]
        ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`**:
        ```yaml
        version: '3.8'

        services:
            app:
                build: .
                ports:
                    - "3000:3000"
                volumes:
                    - .:/app
                    - /app/node_modules
                environment:
                    - NODE_ENV=development
        ```
