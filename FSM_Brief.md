# FSM Project Brief Overview

The FSM project aims to develop a comprehensive job/work order management system with scheduling, dispatch, and mobile app capabilities for technicians. The project will be implemented in two phases, with phase 1 focusing on the core features and phase 2 introducing expansion features.

## Phase 1: Core Features

The core features of the FSM project include:

- Job/Work Order Management: Create, update, and track work orders. Assign jobs and provide job details. Implement a simple, intuitive interface for job management. Ensure technicians receive detailed job instructions and customer information.

- Scheduling and Dispatch: Develop basic scheduling capabilities with a calendar view. Implement real-time dispatch through notifications or SMS.

- Mobile App for Technicians: Enable viewing and accepting job assignments. Allow updating job status. Capture and upload photos. Use Flutter or React Native for cross-platform compatibility.

## Phase 2: Expansion Features

The expansion features of the FSM project include:

- Customer Portal: Develop a web-based portal for customers to view and manage service requests. Implement real-time updates.

- Inventory and Parts Management: Track inventory and implement a parts ordering system.

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is as follows:

- Month 1-2: Focus on Job/Work Order Management
- Month 3: Scheduling and Dispatch
- Month 4: Mobile App for Technicians
- Month 5: Customer Portal (Phase 2)
- Month 6: Inventory and Parts Management (Phase 2)

## Technical Notes

The project will utilize the following technical setup:

- CI/CD Setup with GitHub Actions: A workflow file will be created in the `.github/workflows` directory to enable continuous integration and deployment.

- Dev Containers: A devcontainer.json file will be added to the `.devcontainer` directory to provide a consistent development environment using Node.js and TypeScript.

- Docker Setup: A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file will be created to facilitate containerized development.
